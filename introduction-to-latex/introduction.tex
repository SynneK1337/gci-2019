Hello. My name is Emilian, but on the internet I have been known as 'synnek'. I am 15 years old. My hobby is widely-described IT - especially coding and security, but also videomaking and VFX/Motion Design.
Currently I am participating in Google Code-In 2019 Challange for Fedora Organization. But in a past, I have made a few projects that I think can intrest you. You can look at them on my \href{https://github.com/synnek1337/}{GitHub}
