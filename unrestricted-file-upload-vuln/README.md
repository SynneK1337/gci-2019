# Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability
## How unrestricted file uploader may cause your server unsecure?
Many websites offer functionality to upload files like Images, Videos etc. Unexperienced webdevs
may does not know, that if this functionality is not implemented properly, it may be easy for attack to use it, to get [Arbitary Code Execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution).
Web apps use a lot of scripts being executed on server-side nowadays. One of the most popular server-side scripting technologies is [PHP](https://php.net/). If file uploader is not implemented properly, it may allow attacker to upload their own PHP Script to webserver. (Un)fortunely, PHP has ability to access shell using ```system()``` function.

## Proof of Concept
For this example, I am using [DVWA](https://github.com/ethicalhack3r/DVWA) - web application frequently used by beginner pentesters to learn websecurity. DVWA is set to the easiest difficulty level. In this case, the file uploader completly does not check the type of uploaded file.

### Exploit Code:
```php
<?php
echo system($_GET["cmd"])
?>
```
By the way, metasploit has PHP exploit `php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` which has much more options than this one-liner above.
### After uploading our exploit as an 'image', we got following result:
![upload](resources/upload.png)

### And when we go to ```hackable/uploads/exploit.php``` and put some bash commend into ```cmd``` get parameter, we got following output:
![result](resources/exploit_result.png) \
So, as you can see, I obtained full control of web-server.

## But what if my web-app just check Content-Type header of HTTP Request?
Unfortunelly, `Content-Type` header type can be easily spoofed using web proxy such as [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp).

## What about whitelisting file extensions?
In general, it is ok, but you must have knowledge about few tricks in the back of your head.
- If an extension check is being procesed on client-side using e.g. JavaScript, then it can by bypassed by changing file name to `exploit.jpg` and then, after check is passed, file name can be changed using web proxy.
- Double extensions e.g `exploit.php.jpg` should be reviewed too.

## What about PHP's `getimagesize()`?
It can be easily bypassed using tool like `gifsicle`.

## So what can I do, to make my file uploader secure?
- The file types allowed to be uploaded should be restricted to only those that are necessary for business functionality.
- Never accept a filename and its extension directly without having a whitelist filter.
- The application should perform filtering and content checking on any files which are uploaded to the server. Files should be thoroughly scanned and validated before being made available to other users. If in doubt, the file should be discarded.
- It is necessary to have a list of only permitted extensions on the web application. And, file extension can be selected from the list. For instance, it can be a "select case" syntax (in case of having VBScript) to choose the file extension in regards to the real file extension.
- All the control characters and Unicode ones should be removed from the filenames and their extensions without any exception. Also, the special characters such as ";", ":", ">", "<", "/" ,"\", additional ".", "*", "%", "$", and so on should be discarded as well. If it is applicable and there is no need to have Unicode characters, it is highly recommended to only accept Alpha-Numeric characters and only 1 dot as an input for the file name and the extension; in which the file name and also the extension should not be empty at all (regular expression: [a-zA-Z0-9]{1,200}\.[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,10}).
- Limit the filename length. For instance, the maximum length of the name of a file plus its extension should be less than 255 characters (without any directory) in an NTFS partition.
It is recommended to use an algorithm to determine the filenames. For instance, a filename can be a MD5 hash of the name of file plus the date of the day.
- Uploaded directory should not have any "execute" permission and all the script handlers should be removed from these directories.
Limit the file size to a maximum value in order to prevent denial of service attacks (on file space or other web application’s functions such as the image resizer).
- Restrict small size files as they can lead to denial of service attacks. So, the minimum size of files should be considered.
- Use Cross Site Request Forgery protection methods.
- Prevent from overwriting a file in case of having the same hash for both.
- Use a virus scanner on the server (if it is applicable). Or, if the contents of files are not confidential, a free virus scanner website can be used. In this case, file should be stored with a random name and without any extension on the server first, and after the virus checking (uploading to a free virus scanner website and getting back the result), it can be renamed to its specific name and extension.
- Try to use POST method instead of PUT (or GET!)
- Log users’ activities. However, the logging mechanism should be secured against log forgery and code injection itself.
- In case of having compressed file extract functions, contents of the compressed file should be checked one by one as a new file.
- If it is possible, consider saving the files in a database rather than on the filesystem.
- If files should be saved in a filesystem, consider using an isolated server with a different domain to serve the uploaded files.
- File uploaders should be only accessible to authenticated and authorised users if possible.
- Write permission should be removed from files and folders other than the upload folders. The upload folders should not serve any
- Ensure that configuration files such as ".htaccess" or "web.config" cannot be replaced using file uploaders. Ensure that appropriate settings are available to ignore the ".htaccess" or "web.config" files if uploaded in the upload directories.
- Ensure that files with double extensions (e.g. "file.php.txt") cannot be executed especially in Apache.
- Ensure that uploaded files cannot be accessed by unauthorised users.
- Adding the "Content-Disposition: Attachment" and "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff" headers to the response of static files will secure the website against Flash or PDF-based cross-site content-hijacking attacks. It is recommended that this practice be performed for all of the files that users need to download in all the modules that deal with a file download. Although this method does not fully secure the website against attacks using Silverlight or similar objects, it can mitigate the risk of using Adobe Flash and PDF objects, especially when uploading PDF files is permitted.
- Flash/PDF (crossdomain.xml) or Silverlight (clientaccesspolicy.xml) cross-domain policy files should be removed if they are not in use and there is no business requirement for Flash or Silverlight applications to communicate with the website.
- Browser caching should be disabled for the corssdomain.xml and clientaccesspolicy.xml files. This enables the website to easily update the file or restrict access to the Web services if necessary. Once the client access policy file is checked, it remains in effect for the browser session so the impact of non-caching to the end-user is minimal. This can be raised as a low or informational risk issue based on the content of the target website and security and complexity of the policy file(s).
- CORS headers should be reviewed to only be enabled for static or publicly accessible data. Otherwise, the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header should only contain authorised addresses. Other CORS headers such as "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" should only be used when they are required. Items within the CORS headers such as "Access-Control-Allow-Methods" or "Access-Control-Allow-Headers" should be reviewed and removed if they are not required.
